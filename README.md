2. Track video access through detailed security logs
3. Manage all aspects of video security

### Technical Details

The plugin implements multiple layers of protection:

- **Server-side Protection**:
  - Signed URLs with short expiration times
  - Chunked video delivery
  - Content-Security-Policy headers
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Access logging

- **Client-side Protection**:
  - JavaScript barriers to prevent downloading
  - Custom video controls
  - Watermarking with customer identification
  - DevTools detection

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

While this plugin implements multiple layers of protection, no system can provide 100% security against determined attackers. The plugin focuses on preventing casual copying by typical users while maintaining a good viewing experience.

For absolute security of extremely valuable content, consider additional DRM solutions or streaming services that specialize in high-security media delivery.
