## üé¨ How It Works

### For Customers

1. Customers purchase video products through WooCommerce
2. Once purchased, videos appear in their account dashboard under "My Videos"
3. Customers can stream videos securely without being able to download them
4. Each video stream includes a watermark with the customer's email address

### For Admins

1. Upload videos directly to products (up to 2GB with chunked upload)
2. Track video access through comprehensive analytics dashboard
3. Monitor video performance with real-time statistics
4. Export analytics data for reporting and analysis
5. Manage all aspects of video security

### Technical Details

The plugin implements multiple layers of protection:

- **Server-side Protection**:
  - Signed URLs with short expiration times
  - Chunked video delivery
  - Content-Security-Policy headers
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Access logging

- **Client-side Protection**:
  - JavaScript barriers to prevent downloading
  - Custom video controls
  - Watermarking with customer identification
  - DevTools detection

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

While this plugin implements multiple layers of protection, no system can provide 100% security against determined attackers. The plugin focuses on preventing casual copying by typical users while maintaining a good viewing experience.

For absolute security of extremely valuable content, consider additional DRM solutions or streaming services that specialize in high-security media delivery.
